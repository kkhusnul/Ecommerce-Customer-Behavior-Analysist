KEY BUSINESS INSIGHTS

1. Churn Is Primarily Driven by Behavioral Decline
Churned customers consistently exhibit lower engagement levels, including reduced login frequency and shorter session durations. 
This indicates that churn is typically preceded by a gradual disengagement rather than an abrupt decision.
Purchase inactivity and customer dependency also shown as strong churn indicator.

Insight:
Behavioral decline and dependency increasement are early and reliable signal of churn risk.

2. Payment Flexibility Is Linked to Higher Lifetime Value
Customers using multiple payment methods generally demonstrate higher purchase frequency and greater lifetime value, 
suggesting reduced friction and improved checkout experience.

Insight:
Payment flexibility supports repeat purchasing and customer retention.

3. Customer Health Score Effectively Identifies At-Risk Customers
A composite customer health score—combining engagement, purchase frequency, and recency—clearly differentiates healthy customers from those at risk of churn.

Insight:
Composite behavioral scoring provides stronger churn signals.

4. Mobile App Usage Strengthens Customer Engagement
Customers with a higher mobile app usage rate consistently demonstrate higher login frequency and longer session durations. 
This indicates that mobile app users engage with the platform more frequently and for longer periods, reflecting stronger product adoption and deeper customer involvement.

Insight:
Investing in mobile app experience—such as usability improvements, personalization, and push notifications—can significantly enhance overall engagement metrics, which are key drivers of retention and lifetime value.
