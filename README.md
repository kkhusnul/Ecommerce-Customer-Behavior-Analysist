# Ecommerce-Customer-Behavior-Analysist
This project demonstrates my SQL skills through end-to-end analysis of an ecommerce customer dataset, focusing on customer behavior, revenue analysis, and churn risk. The analysis is designed to simulate real business scenarios commonly faced by data analysts, product analysts, and business intelligence teams.
The goal of this project is to:
•	Extract actionable insights from raw data
•	Apply SQL to solve business problems
•	Communicate findings clearly and logically

**Dataset Description**
This is a comprehensive Customer Engagement and Churn Analytics Dataset containing behavioral, demographic, and transactional data for 50,000 customers across a global e-commerce/subscription platform. The dataset captures 25 distinct features that provide a 360-degree view of customer interactions and engagement patterns.

The dataset contains customer-level ecommerce data, including:
•	Demographics (country, age, gender)
•	Engagement metrics (logins, session duration, pages per session)
•	Purchase behavior (order value, discounts, returns)
•	Customer service interactions
•	Financial metrics (lifetime value, credit balance)
•	Churn indicator
