This project demonstrates my SQL skills through end-to-end analysis of an ecommerce customer dataset, focusing on customer behavior, revenue analysis, and churn risk. The analysis is designed to simulate real business scenarios commonly faced by data analysts, product analysts, and business intelligence teams.
